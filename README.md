# Diagnostic Bayesian Network

Consider a particular medical condition with 1/12 prevalence in the population.
 
There are two tests for this condition and doctors randomly choose test 1 with probability 1/3 and test 2  with probability 2/3. 
 
If a given individual has the condition, test 1 would always correctly identify this and test 2 would correctly identify this with probability 5/6.

If a given individual does not have the condition, test 1 correctly identifies this with probability 1/2 and test 2 correctly identifies this with probability 3/4.

Imagine an individual is chosen completely at random from the population, they receive one of the tests, and the test comes out positive. What is the probability that the individual actually has the disease?

**Approximately 1 in 5 positively tested patients will actually have the condition.**
